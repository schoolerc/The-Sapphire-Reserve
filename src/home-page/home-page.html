        <h1>This site is currently a work in progress!</h1>
        <p>Feel free to look around, but this site is still being written! Please don't be surprised if something doesn't work. I'm probably trying to fix it right now.</p>
        <p>The intent of this site is to be a productivity tool and assistant for both players and DM's for 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons. While a lot of people, myself included, prefer to have a physical medium in front of them, there are still items and tasks that can be improved upon with technology. And that is the purpose of this website.</p>
        <h2>Working Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Spell Cards & Searching</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>In Progress</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Monster Cards & Searching</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Combat Tracker</li>
            <li>Character Sheets</li>
            <li>Campaign Management</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Contributing</h3>
        <p>Hey! You there!</p>
        <p>Do you happen to have a knack for web based development and are interested in contributing to the development of this site?</p>
        <p>Well I'm flattered. Email me at schooler.charles@gmail.com with the subject line 'Contributing to The Sapphire Reserve' along with what you'd be interested in contributing to. The technology stack will be a Polymer based front end (you're looking at it now) and a Ruby on Rails web application to handle the dynamic content.</p>
        <p>Cheers!</p>
