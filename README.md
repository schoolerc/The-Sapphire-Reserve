# The Sapphire Reserve



## The Purpose

I've recently started a Dungeons & Dragons campaign using the 5th edition rules. Many of the people involved in this haven't actually played any form of table top RPG before, and I want to make it so that they aren't required to buy any of the books if they don't want to.

## The Goal

Create a new platform with productivity and reference tools that allow Dungeon Masters the ability to easily store and reference any content they create for their campaigns, as well as the core rules.

## The Technologies

Right now the website is utilizing Polymer for the majority of the front end development. Integration with a ruby on rails web application for the storage and display of dynamically generated content is planned.
